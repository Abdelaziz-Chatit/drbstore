HOW TO PUSH CODE TO REPOSITORY

1. CHECK STATUS OF YOUR CHANGES
   Command: git status
   This shows which files have been modified, added, or deleted

2. ADD FILES TO STAGING AREA
   Add all changes:
   Command: git add .
   
   OR add specific files:
   Command: git add <filename>
   Example: git add routes/admin.js

3. COMMIT YOUR CHANGES
   Command: git commit -m "Your commit message"
   Example: git commit -m "Fix back buttons for role-aware routing"
   
   Good commit message practices:
   - Be clear and descriptive
   - Explain WHAT changed and WHY
   - Use present tense: "Fix" not "Fixed"
   - Keep it concise (50 characters or less for first line)

4. PUSH TO REMOTE REPOSITORY
   Command: git push
   
   OR push to specific branch:
   Command: git push origin <branch-name>
   Example: git push origin main

5. FULL WORKFLOW EXAMPLE
   git status                          (check what changed)
   git add .                          (stage all changes)
   git commit -m "Fix admin routing"  (commit changes)
   git push                           (push to repository)

6. TROUBLESHOOTING
   If push is rejected:
   - Pull first: git pull origin main
   - Then push: git push origin main
   
   View your branches:
   - git branch (local branches)
   - git branch -a (all branches including remote)

7. USEFUL COMMANDS
   View commit history: git log
   View changes before committing: git diff
   Undo last commit: git reset HEAD~1
   Cancel changes in file: git checkout -- <filename>
